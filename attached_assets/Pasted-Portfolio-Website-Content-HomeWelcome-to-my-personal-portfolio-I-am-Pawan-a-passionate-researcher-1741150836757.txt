HomeWelcome to my personal portfolio! I am Pawan, a passionate researcher at the intersection of computational chemistry, machine learning, and materials science. With a strong foundation in chemistry and expertise in artificial intelligence, I aim to develop computational frameworks that accelerate scientific discovery.

About MeI hold a Master's degree in Chemistry from IIT Madras and currently work as a Project Associate at CSIR CLRI, where I develop machine learning models for classifying toxic chemicals. My experience extends to an internship at IIT Madras, where I explored machine learning applications in drug discovery.

My research interests lie in AI-assisted modeling of molecular interactions, computational chemistry, and scientific machine learning. I am particularly focused on leveraging large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance predictive modeling in materials and chemical sciences.

I am excited to embark on my PhD journey in Computational Materials Science under Prof. Dr. Marek Sierka, where I will work on integrating simulation workflows and automating the characterization and analysis of advanced materials.
